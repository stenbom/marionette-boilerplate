Marionette Boilerplate
======================
A simple application structure for RESTful marionette applications. It doesn't force you to have a specific folder structure it's merely boilerplate code to get started quickly.


__Front-end,__ Require and Backbone Marionette.

__Back-end,__ Node (express and mongoose) 


Starting the server
----------------------
The server serves the index.html file under ./public. It also provides a  minimalistic REST API to create blog posts (as an example).

	$ node bin/server


Structure
----------------------
The application files can be found under the `app/` directory. The server is only one file and is found under the `bin/` directory.
